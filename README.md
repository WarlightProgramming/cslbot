A bot to automate Warlight ladders, leagues, and tournaments using the Community-Supported League (CSL) framework.

## Features

* Automatically run multiple Warlight leagues using Google Sheets.

* Control a wide range of details such as rating system, whether the league is
  multi-day/real-time, which players are allowed in the league, and how to
  handle boots and declines.

* Ability to set up a league in minutes without any knowledge of code or
  servers.

## Installation and Usage

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/knyte/cslbot/wiki) for an explanation
for the CSL framework, the Interface API, and setting up cslbot instances and
League Clusters.

If you want to deploy your own cslbot instance, see the
[INSTALLATION](https://github.com/knyte/cslbot/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md)
file. Note that you do not need to deploy your own Bot just to run a Cluster.
